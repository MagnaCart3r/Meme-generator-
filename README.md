I've built  this  engaging meme application with a 
Beautiful gradient background with a clean, responsive layout
Grid view of 4 memes with smooth loading states
Functional sharing buttons for Twitter and WhatsApp
"New Memes" button to fetch fresh content
Smooth animations and transitions
Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
The app fetches memes from rapidapi.com and displays them in a 2x2 grid. Each meme card has sharing buttons that appear on a semi-transparent overlay. 
The "New Memes" button at the top refreshes all memes simultaneously. and a button to refresh each meme card without refreshing the other meme cards
